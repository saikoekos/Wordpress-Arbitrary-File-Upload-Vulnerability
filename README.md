# Week 3: Engineering

## Exploit

Exploit Name: Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability in Wordpress Dreamwork Gallery Plugin

Summary: For this exploit we are going to demonstrate how wordpress websites with the [wp-dreamworkgallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dreamworkgallery/) plugin are vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads.

My Contributions: This vulnerability was already discovered around June 2016, but my post here today is going to share a python script written by myself that is capable of exploiting this vulnerability and confirming whether or not the exploit was a success.

Prior Work: Everything made here was based solely off the work found in the three links provied

## Getting Started

In order to begin, we are going to have to first setup our target. 
For my target I used an ec2 free tier instance from [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) running Ubuntu V. 16.04
If you want to follow along with an AWs instance (or any instance from any other service) ensure that your network settings allow incoming traffic. You could specify specific rules, but demonstration I'm just going to allow all traffic.

Once you have your instance ready and you're inside and at the terminal, let's go ahead and begin setup with

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Dam530/CyberSecurity2_Week3.git
```

Now still from your current directory, let's run

```
? chmod +x ./CyberSecurity2_Week3/init.sh
? ./CyberSecurity2_Week3/init.sh
```
