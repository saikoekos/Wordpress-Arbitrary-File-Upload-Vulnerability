# Week 3: Engineering

## Exploit

Exploit Name: Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability in Wordpress Dreamwork Gallery Plugin

Summary: For this exploit we are going to demonstrate how wordpress websites with the [wp-dreamworkgallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dreamworkgallery/) plugin are vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads.

My Contributions: This vulnerability was already discovered around June 2016, but my post here today is going to share a python script written by myself that is capable of exploiting this vulnerability and confirming whether or not the exploit was a success.

Prior Work: Everything made here was based solely off the work found in the three links provied

## Setting up the target

In order to begin, we are going to have to first setup our target. 
For my target I used an ec2 free tier instance from [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) running Ubuntu V. 16.04
If you want to follow along with an AWs instance (or any instance from any other service) ensure that your network settings allow incoming traffic. You could specify specific rules, but demonstration I'm just going to allow all traffic.

Once you have your instance ready and you're inside and at the terminal, let's go ahead and begin setup with

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Dam530/CyberSecurity2_Week3.git
```

Now still from your current directory, let's run

```
? chmod +x ./CyberSecurity2_Week3/init.sh
? ./CyberSecurity2_Week3/init.sh
```

Continue? Y
Continue? Y
mysql password: toor12345
confirm: toor12345
Continue? Y
Enter Password For User Root: toor12345
N
N
Y
Y
Y
Y
All Done!

After going through the initialization, there's just a couple more things we need to do!
Let's get our mysql database going with

```
? mysql -u root -p 
Enter Password: toor12345
...
...
mysql> CREATE DATABASE wp_myblog;
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wp_myblog.* TO 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'toor12345';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> EXIT;
```

ONLY FOLLOW THIS NEXT STEP IF YOU DID NOT USE THE FOLLOWING MYSQL CREDENTIALS
username: root
password: toor12345

```
? cd /var/www/html
? vim wp-config.php
```

Inside here, ensure these settings are correct

```
define('DB_NAME', '[YOUR_DATABASE_NAME]')
define('DB_USER', '[YOUR DATABASE USER]')
define('DB_PASSWORD', '[YOUR DATABASE PASSWORD]')
```

Go ahead and save those adjustments if you needed to make them and let's get wordpress up and running.
Let's go ahead and grab our public IP with

```
? curl -s checkip.dyndns.org | sed -e 's/.*Current IP Address: //' -e 's/<.*$//'
18.220.50.103	
```

In my case, my public IP is [18.220.50.103]. Assuming that you don't have browser access if you are SSH'ed into your instance, we can use this IP to access our WP from our local machine.

Let's use the following settings

Afterwards, login and access the Plugins page and activate "Dreamwork Gallery" plugin that should already be installed.

Next, let's publish a new post like this

Now go to the post and ensure that the XML entity runs (it should be blank like shown in the following image).

GREAT! Now our target is ready to be attacked. Let's go and setup our attacker.

## Setting up for the attack

For this section, I used a Kali Linux VM. Honestly, I'm pretty sure any form of linux vm that is capable of running python3 on it should suffice.

Booting into my Kali VM, I'm going to start by cloning this repo again.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Dam530/CyberSecurity2_Week3.git
```

Excellent, now let's start uploading whatever we damn please on this site.
